# Industrial-Copper-Modeling

INTRODUCTION


An industrial copper modeling project is a comprehensive initiative aimed at simulating and analyzing the various aspects of copper production within an industrial context. This project encompasses the use of advanced modeling techniques and data analysis to understand and optimize the processes involved in copper mining, refining, and manufacturing. The goal is to improve efficiency, reduce environmental impacts, and enhance the overall productivity of the copper industry. 
This project aims to develop two machine learning models for the copper industry to address the challenges of predicting selling price and lead classification. Manual predictions can be time-consuming and may not result in optimal pricing decisions or accurately capture leads. The models will utilize advanced techniques such as data normalization, outlier detection and handling, handling data in the wrong format, identifying the distribution of features, and leveraging tree-based models, specifically the decision tree algorithm, to predict the selling price and leads accurately.

Regression model details

The copper industry deals with less complex data related to sales and pricing. However, this data may suffer from issues such as skewness and noisy data, which can affect the accuracy of manual predictions. Dealing with these challenges manually can be time-consuming and may not result in optimal pricing decisions. A machine learning regression model can address these issues by utilizing advanced techniques such as data normalization, outlier detection and handling, handling data in wrong format, identifying the distribution of features, and leveraging tree-based models, specifically the decision tree algorithm.

A decision tree regression model can be a valuable tool for calculating the selling price in an industrial copper modeling project.

Classification model details

Another area where the copper industry faces challenges is in capturing the leads. A lead classification model is a system for evaluating and classifying leads based on how likely they are to become a customer. You can use the STATUS variable with WON being considered as Success and LOST being considered as Failure and remove data points other than WON, LOST STATUS values.
A confusion matrix is a valuable tool for assessing the performance of a classification model. It provides a detailed breakdown of the model's predictions and helps in evaluating its accuracy, precision, recall, and other performance metrics.

Solution


The solution includes the following steps:

Exploring skewness and outliers in the dataset.

Transforming the data into a suitable format and performing any necessary cleaning and pre-processing steps.

Developing a machine learning regression model which predicts the continuous variable 'Selling_Price' using the decision tree regressor.

Developing a machine learning classification model which predicts the Status: WON or LOST using the decision tree classifier.

Creating a Streamlit page where you can insert each column value and get the Selling_Price predicted value or Status (Won/Lost).
